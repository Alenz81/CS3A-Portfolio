**I used a library called SFML in the creation of this project**

https://www.sfml-dev.org/

This is a portfolio of some projects done in my CS3A class (second level of C++ programming done at community college). 

It includes:

Green Circle (Which is just a green circle)
Bouncing Balls (Circles bouncing around the edges of the screen)
SFML 2D Array (Similar to static on a TV screen)
Playing Card (Unfinished demo from in class)
Phaser (Movable Character)
Poker Analysis (Draws poker hands until you draw a Royal Flush)
SFML Drum Hero (Rock Band Drums)
